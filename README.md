# qt-graph

## Project Summary

qt-graph is a Qt-based desktop application for plotting mathematical functions. Users can select from three predefined functions, set custom intervals and step sizes, and visualize the graphs interactively. The interface allows toggling functions, adjusting axes ranges, and clearing the plot. This project demonstrates basic Qt GUI programming and dynamic graph rendering using C++ and the Qt framework.
